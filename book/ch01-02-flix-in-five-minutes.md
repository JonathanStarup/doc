| Paradigm                             | multi-paradigm: functional, logic             |
| Typing discipline                    | static, strong, safe, nominative              |
| Type inference                       | local Hindley-Milner                          |
| Type annotations                     | locally inferred, mandatory at top-level      |
| Evaluation mode                      | compilation to bytecode + interpretation      |
| Evaluation order                     | strict, call-by-value                         |
| Functions                            | pure (side-effect free), total                |
| Fixedpoint Solver                    | bottom-up, parallel                           |
| Syntax inspired by                   | Scala, Python, OCaml, Datalog                 |
| Library inspired by                  | Scala, Haskell                                |
| Platform                             | Java / JVM 1.8+                               |
